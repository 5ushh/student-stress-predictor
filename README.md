# Student Stress Predictor

Machine Learning final project for ECE-GY 6143.

## Overview
This project predicts student academic stress levels (Low, Medium, High) using
lifestyle and academic features such as study hours, sleep duration, physical activity,
screen time, and academic workload.

A progressive modeling approach was used:
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest (non-linear interactions)
- Neural Network (behavioral feature learning)

## Files
- `student_stress_ml.ipynb` – Complete implementation and experiments
- `final_ml_project.pdf` – Final project report with results and analysis

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (Neural Network)

## Results
The neural network achieved the highest accuracy (99.6%), while Random Forest
provided strong interpretability through feature importance analysis.
